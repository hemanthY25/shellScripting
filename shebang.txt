Shebang denoted as #!

The #! syntax is used in scripts to indicate an interpreter for execution under
UNIX / Linux operating systems. The directive must be the first line in the 
Linux shell script. You can add argument after the shebang characters,
 which is optional. Make sure the interpreter is the
full path to a binary file. For example: #!/bin/bash.

#!/path/to/interpreter [arguments]

Arguments are optional.
